          <p>As a way to engage students entering the Junior High, the technology department at <a href="http://gufsd.org">Greenport UFSD</a> was tasked with creating a solution for displaying hash tagged Instagram photos on the wall while students ate lunch during their 7th grade orientation. In less than an hour a system was put in place to post photos taken by staff to a central Instagram account, display the photos on the wall using a web application running on a Chromebook, digital signage at the school was also updated to inform students about the hashtag. After orientation, a Storify was built to outline the event and the building's digital signage was updated to display photos from the occasion.</p>

          <h2>East End Seaport Museum Print Collateral</h2>
          <p>In an effort to align all marketing and communications channels, the <a href="http://eastendseaport.org">East End Seaport Museum</a> has started updating all of its print collateral. New rack cards with a focus on explaining the core mission of the museum and outlining membership options were developed while working closely with museum staff. Additionally, as a way to connect with guests of a recent fundraiser thank you post cards were designed using cues from our branding and style guides. Brochures, cruise pamphlets,  window and lawn signs, etc were also developed over the course of the summer season as a way to drive foot traffic and increase value for visitors.</p>

          <p>After the 25th annual <a href="http://eastendmaritimefestival.org">East End Maritime Festival</a> it became clear the festival had grown to the point of needing its own web presence. One of the requirements for the project was to pick a platform that was not only easy to use, but capable of growing with the festival. Squarespace was an obvious choice given the requirements, and the built-in e-commerce platform made setting up vendor sign-ups quick and simple. By adhering to the museum style guide, we were able to create a site that fits with the newly established museum brand while still making the Maritime Festival site feel like its own space.</p>

          <p>In an effort to attract a younger demographic and increase sales, the <a href="http://eastendseaport.org">East End Seaport Museum</a> asked me to tackle their website. Because we had used Squarespace for the <a href="#p3">Maritime Festival site</a> due to its ease of use, we made the decision to move the main site there as well. Moving to Squarespace opened up opportunities that the previous website prevented such as quickly embedding multimedia, or selling tickets to events. One of the most successful aspects of the switch has been the integrated e-commerce platform. Being able to quickly provide a place for private events renting museum property to sell tickets and accept donations has been a great way to increase revenue.</p>

          <p>As a way to begin learning iOS development and Objective-C, I partnered with local not-for-profit radio station <a href="http://wpkn.org">WPKN</a> to build them a live streaming iOS application. The first version of the app was iPhone only, with an update coming a few weeks later that introduced native support for the iPad. In addition to streaming the live broadcast, the app also allows you to browse the station's website where you can learn more about the programming or make a donation.</p>
